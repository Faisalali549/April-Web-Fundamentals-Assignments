          The Taj Mahal, is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of
          the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in
          1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his
          favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan
          himself.
          <br />Who could ever think that an eternal love leading to the saga of
          infinite bondage can evolve out of a desert like land and would
          blossom to be the reason to gift our world a poem-in-marble, The Taj!
          No image of The Taj, neither on canvass nor on celluloid, can
          adequately express its conceptual imaginary nor convey the legend, the
          poetry and the romance that shrouds what Rabindranath Tagore calls "a
          teardrop on the cheek of time". The Taj Mahal, a spectacle in white
          marble, unparalleled in grandeur that depicts the sheer opulence of an
          era. The awesome structure, the monument of love that Mughal Emperor
          Shah Jahan gave to the world, stands as a testimony of his intense
          love for his wife Mumtaz Mahal.
